It was flying at an altitude of approx. 300-400 feet, and was viewed for several minutes until exiting our field of view.  It flew with its long axis in a horizontal orientation, and did not appear to change direction or altitude.\n",

      "There were no surface details visible on the cylinder, no visible connection between the frame and the cylinder, there were no lights and no sound.\n",

All of the structure appeared to be of the same material and cross-sectional size, which must have been several inches wide (maybe 6-12 inches).  Spacing between each horizontal or ring member was 4-5 feet.\n",
